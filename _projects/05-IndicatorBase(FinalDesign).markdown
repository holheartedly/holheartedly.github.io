name: Indicator Base (Final Design)
description: A base to hold a cable connector as a pressure gage is used to measure specific points. This is the final design of the base. It was originally designed to be handheld but was later altered to be stationary.

Indicator Base (Final Design)
-----------------------------

<img class="image fit" src="/images/05IndicatorBaseFinal.jpg">

The indicator base went through many stages of alternations due to changes in
the customerâ€™s conditions. The purpose of the indicator base was to hold a cable
while it was being measured by a pressure gage. The initial design of the
indictor was scrapped because the initial base provided an unstable platform
which led to inaccurate measurement. The final design had the base stationary.
There are ball bearings on the inner tube of the base which helps hold and
stabilize the cable as it is being measured from a pressure gage on top.
Compared to the initial design, the final design allowed for a more accurate
measurement reading.
