Pin Cleaner

The pin cleaner was developed to reduce the fallout rate of network cables.
Because network cables have such high tolerances, it is very important that the
connection between the cable and network connector is clean. After a cable is
cut by a rotating tool, the insulation is removed but there are a lot of debris
and residue still left inside. To clean the cable, the rotating pin cleaner will
be inserted into the cable. The quarter circle cavities will remove the debris
and residue which will then flow out of the cleaner through the slits on the
side. The fallout rate was reduced with the help of the pin cleaner.
