Problem: Fallout rate for network cables was very high.

Solution: Because network cables have such high tolerances, it is very important
that the connection between the cable and network connector is clean. After a
cable is cut by a rotating tool, the insulation is removed but there are a lot
of debris and residue still left inside. To clean the cable, the rotating pin
cleaner will be inserted into the cable. The quarter circle cavities will remove
the debris and residue which will then flow out of the cleaner through the slits
on the side. The fallout rate was reduced with the help of the pin cleaner.
