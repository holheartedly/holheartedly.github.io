Indicator Base (3D Initial)
---------------------------

Problem: I am not sure how the design will feel and operate in real life.

Solution: This is the 3D printer version of the initial design of the indicator base. The
biggest difference between this design and the initial design is there is
significantly less material in this design. I removed a lot of material from the
foundation and I made the walls that hold the gage thinner. I altered the design
because the materials used in 3D printing is expensive. The purpose of making
this prototype was to see how the design worked in a real life scenario and to
see how feels in the hand. One reason why this design was scrapped was because
it did not feel good in the hands. Even if the sharp corners and sides were
rounded, the tool did not feel comfortable in the hand. The final design is
designed to be stationary rather than hand held.
