Indicator Base (Initial)
------------------------

Problem: There is no foundation for the new product to rest on while it is being measured.

Solution: This is the initial design for the indicator base. The initial condition of the
project was to have the base be held in the hand. The pressure gage is placed on
the top and the base will rest on the cable. This design was scrapped because
the base was unstable and it gave inaccurate measurement.
