Problem: The CNC department previously had all the tool configurations written on paper.
It caused a lot of confusion because some of the configurations were illegible
and some of the papers were lost.

Solution: To resolve this issue, I created 3D drawings
for each tool configuration for each product that the company sold. If a machine
operator had to make a certain part for a certain product, he/she can pull up
the drawing for that specific tool configuration and set the machine up. To make
the set up more efficient, I had different angular views for the turret and a
list of each of the tool number and name. These drawings helped decrease the CNC
prep time and eliminate possible confusion.
