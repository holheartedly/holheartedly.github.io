Wrapping Clamp
--------------

Problem: Workers were getting hurt and strained from manufacturing cables. The worker would hold a coil of raw cable and
hand feed it into a rotating cutting tool. This process caused strain on the
worker as they tried to balance the coil while keeping it from uncoiling when it
was being cut by the rotating tool.

Solution: The wrapping clamp was developed to ease the process of preparing a coil of raw
cables into a workable product. This tool is meant to be used on the manufacturing floor which is why the design
was focused more on practicality and less on cosmetic. I used a rubber boot as
the handle because there was an abundance of boots. The boot is made of soft
rubber which provides a comfortable handle for the user to grasp on to. In the
end, the wrapping clamp not only decreased strain, it also decreased lead time.
