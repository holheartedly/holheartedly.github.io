Hi my name is Holman Chung and I am a 4th year mechanical engineer student at
Rochester Institute of Technology.

As an engineer, I am always fascinated with designs that balance beautiful
design and practicality. That is one of the driving forces that push me to
always try my best when I am designing a product or part. When I see a product
that I admire, I like to analyze how it is built/designed and learn from it. I
apply the things I learn and observe to my designs so that I can continuously
grow as a designer. Besides always trying to improve my skills, I like to learn
about the latest break through in technology such as carbon fiber and 3D
printing. I am always curious about the newest technology because it always
opens up new doors in designing.

When I have a break from schoolwork and club activities, I enjoy spending time
on my hobbies. I have numerous hobbies such as photography, cycling, playing
piano, and being a tea enthusiast.

If you are interested in my previous projects, please head over to my project
page to look at them. I am currently looking for a co-op opportunity from June
2015 to December 2015. If you are interested in my resume or contacting me with
questions, please head over to my contact page and send me an email.
